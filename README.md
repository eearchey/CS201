# CS201
Portfolio Project for CS201. This program creates a food diary based off of data from the USDA branded food item database. Multiple users can make diaries, and those diaries can be edited at any time. Functionality includes searching for foods by a keyword present anywhere in teh name, searching non-linearly for the first word in the name of a food and adding one of the results to the diary if desired, editing previous entries, and deleting previous entries.

To use: Go to https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/. Click the "Downloads" button in the toolbar near the top of the page, then "BFPD ASCII Files". Download the zip file, then open it to get Nutrients.csv, Products.csv, and Serving_size.csv, and place them in the same folder as database.c, database.h, main.c, and makefile. Run the script given in script.txt (excluding the comment line) in the terminal. From that, the file called "food_database.csv" should be created. Then type make to compile the program. Following that, to run the program, type in "./port food_database.csv".
